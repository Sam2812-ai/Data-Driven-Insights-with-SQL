Amazon operates multiple branches with diverse of products, but identifying key factor driving sales 
success across branches, product line and customer segments remain challenging.
The datasets contain sales transactions from 3 different branches of Amazon, respectively located 
in Mumbai, Delhi & Jaipur. The data contain 17 columns and 1000 rows. 
I have used approaches like i.e. Data wrangling, Feature Engineering and Expletory Data Analysis. 
Tools Used. (Excel/CSV files for preparation and a SQL database)
